		<h2>Mr. Falzata Champions League</h2>
		<p>As a way to gain experience in the web development industry, I decided to approach a high school coach who taugh physical education at St. Joseph Secondary School in Mississauga. He carried on a tournament-like structure in his lessons where his students picked different teams and represented them every week. He would then write down a report on the player's statistics and humorous recaps of each week's matchups. I worked with him to turn this into a website where the players could see their stats online, see the award nominations and read about each week's game online. This project was very insightful when it came to content management and adaptation. Even though I had some content to work with, there was still a lot I had to produce myself (including some photographic content and writing) and I worked carefully to keep a consistent tone and aesthetic that added both a satirical and professional feel to the site.</p> 
		
		<p>This was a project done with bootstrap and JavaScript. I dedicated much time to the css customization of the elements so that there was some originality to the site. It was a perfect way to practice the bootstrap grid layout as I had to deal with the arrangement of player cards. The use of javascript was useful to develop two of the pages, creating a carousel-like content where the users could swap between each week's recap and results without the necessity of redirecting them to more html files.</p>
