		<h2>Sofia's Tea</h2>
		<p>The idea behind this website was simple, one of my friends dreams was to open up a bakery with her sister. This gave me the idea of basing the website off of this business idea. Of course the business does not actually exist which is why the photographies were hard to obtain so I had to rely on a few images from the web which are free for public use. I chose the Sheridan website as an inspiration because I was very fascinated by its simple but elegant design. Its home page did not feature any unnecessary content making it easy to feature all of its structure without cutting out any sections. I began this project by deciding a color palette. I used an online palette maker to help me choose but also looked at other bakery sites to draw some inspiration. One of the sites I was most drawn by is the company Cobbs Bread. Their primary color is a wine red and they dont really use any other color, instead they use different shades of their primary color making it a very aesthetic site. I finally landed on using purple as the main color of this project and defined it as a function in the root of the CSS.</p> 
		
		<p>This project's main purpose was to practice css and the styling of elements. It was useful to practice things like flexbox and even vanilla JavaScript to make part of the site functional. The next step in my web development repertoir will be to practice making layouts responsive, this will be more efficient and easier with the help of frameworks like bootstrap and tailwind.</p>
