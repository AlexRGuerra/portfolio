		<h2>Sofia's Tea</h2>
		<p>For a design thinking class we came up with a business idea that helped solve an issue for a particular audience of our choice. As university students we realized we frequently develop bad eating habits wether it is skipping meals, ordering food or eating out too often. We wanted to come up with a solution that encouraged students to order groceries more often to both maintain a healthy diet and saving money and time simultaneously. To do so we developed an Xd prototype of website for a company we called Uni-Mart, a concept of an organization that sold groceries in packages with exact measures needed in order to facilitate the cooking process for students. The idea was for the students to order their groceries through our website and have them pick them up in campus in a set location. The high fidelity prototype we presened featured 4 main pages including a home page, about us page, a recipes page and a quiz which was made to help students decide what meals would best suit their taste. </p> 
		
		<p> As stated before, this began as a high fidelity prototype and it was presented to our class-mates and professors. However, after the feedback we recieved on the site, including certain navigation aspects that could use some work I decided to take on the challenge of transforming the project into a resposive functional demo using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I tried my best to copy the template created in Xd using HTML and CSS without relying on any frameworks to polish my coding skills. Plus, I am currently developing the website quiz using 'If Statements' and Booleans for the users to get a suggestion on what food to order. </p>
